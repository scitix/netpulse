NetPulse is a high-performance distributed network device management API framework designed for modern network automation. It provides unified interfaces through persistent connection technology and seamlessly integrates with mainstream open-source tools like Netmiko, NAPALM, and vendor APIs like PyEAPI, making network device management simple, efficient, and reliable.

## Why NetPulse?

![NetPulse Value Proposition](docs/en/assets/images/architecture/project-value-proposition-en.svg)

## System Features

* **High Performance**: Utilizing persistent SSH connections to significantly improve device connection response time and success rate while reducing resource consumption. Compared to traditional connection methods, NetPulse reduces device operation response time from 2-5 seconds to 0.5-0.9 seconds.

* **Distributed Architecture**: Adopts a scalable multi-master node design supporting horizontal scaling. Each node independently handles device connections and command execution, with Redis cluster enabling task coordination. The system achieves high availability through Docker and Kubernetes deployment.

* **Unified Interface**: Provides a unified RESTful API that abstracts vendor-specific differences. Whether it's Cisco, Huawei, or other vendors' devices, they can all be operated through the same API interface, greatly simplifying network automation development.

### Technical Architecture

### Plugin System

NetPulse offers a powerful plugin system supporting various functional extensions:

* **Device Drivers**: 
  - Netmiko support (Cisco/Huawei/Juniper etc.)
  - NAPALM support (Configuration management/State verification)
  - Custom protocol extension support

* **Template Engine**: 
  - Jinja2 configuration templates
  - TextFSM/TTP structured parsing
  - Custom parser support

* **Scheduler**: Load balancing, device affinity, custom strategies

* **Webhook**: Event notification, external triggers, data synchronization

### Docker Quick Deploy

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/netpulse/netpulse.git
cd netpulse

# One-click deployment
bash ./scripts/docker_auto_deploy.sh
```

### Manual Configuration

```bash
# 1. Generate environment configuration
bash ./scripts/setup_env.sh generate

# 2. Configure essential environment variables
cat << EOF > .env
NETPULSE_REDIS__PASSWORD=your_secure_redis_password
NETPULSE_SERVER__API_KEY=your_secure_api_key
TZ=Asia/Shanghai
EOF

# 3. Start the service
docker compose up -d

### Quick API Test

After deployment, test the API with a simple health check:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -H "X-API-KEY: your_secure_api_key" http://localhost:9000/health

# Test device command (replace with your device details)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/device/execute \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_secure_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "driver": "netmiko",
    "connection_args": {
      "device_type": "cisco_ios",
      "host": "192.168.1.1",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "admin123"
    },
    "command": "show version"
  }'
```
